/**
 * Jest Configuration — {{PACKAGE_NAME}}
 *
 * Testing configuration using the `jest-expo` preset for React Native
 * component and service testing. Provides:
 * - Babel transforms for TypeScript and JSX (via jest-expo)
 * - React Native module mocking (Animated, NativeModules, etc.)
 * - Platform-specific file resolution (.ios.ts, .android.ts, .native.ts)
 * - Path alias support (@/ → ./src/)
 *
 * ## Test File Conventions
 *
 * Tests can be placed in two locations:
 * - `__tests__/` directory (any nesting level)
 * - Colocated with source files as `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
 *
 * ## Running Tests
 *
 * ```bash
 * pnpm test              # single run
 * pnpm test:watch        # watch mode
 * pnpm test:coverage     # with coverage report
 * ```
 *
 * @see https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/
 * @see https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/
 *
 * @module {{PACKAGE_NAME}}
 * @category Configuration
